/// A dynamic collection of I/O buffers pre-registered with the kernel.
///
/// `FixedBufPool` allows the application to manage a collection of buffers
/// allocated in memory, that can be registered in the current `tokio-uring`
/// context using the [`register`] method. Unlike [`FixedBufRegistry`],
/// individual buffers are not retrieved by index; instead, an available
/// buffer matching a specified capacity can be retrieved with the [`try_next`]
/// method. This allows some flexibility in managing sets of buffers with
/// different capacity tiers. The need to maintain lists of free buffers,
/// however, imposes additional runtime overhead.
///
/// A `FixedBufPool` value is a lightweight handle for a collection of
/// allocated buffers. Cloning of a `FixedBufPool` creates a new reference to
/// the same collection of buffers.
///
/// The buffers of the collection are not deallocated until:
/// - all `FixedBufPool` references to the collection have been dropped;
/// - all [`FixedBuf`] handles to individual buffers in the collection have
///   been dropped, including the buffer handles owned by any I/O operations
///   in flight;
/// - The `tokio-uring` [`Runtime`] the buffers are registered with
///   has been dropped.
